            <h3>MY PURPOSE WHY I CREATED THIS WEBSITE</h3>
            <p>Hello all my beloved friends, my name's RIEN. The Purpose that I creat this website is to review our memories. Now we are not so close to each other, because we have different goal, learn different skills, different school and different places that makes us busy with our academic not like before when we were studying in same school that we always spend our free time together everyday that we meet each other, make happy time together and do something together. I feel that I really lucky that I can know you and have a best relationship with you. I want to say thank you too for being this frienship. Love all of you so much.</p>
